The `database/` directory contains the source code for the database part of our project, and information on the database. The technical folder within documentation covers a technical overview of the code and files, while the images folder contains any relevant images to the project, including mockups and screenshots. All other overview documentation is located within the main folder.

The `docs/` directory holds basic documentation about the project, including information on the project database, network, and website.

The `network/` directory contains the source code for the database part of our project, and information on the database.

The `public-landing-page/` directory contains the source code for the public landing page of our project, which is a React site hosted on GitHub pages. 

The `react-website/` directory contains the source code for the website part of our project, which runs on React.

For both React sites, the public directory holds images and icons that need to be public to be used. The src directory contains the source code of the site; within this folder, the components section contains components that need to be regenerated or reused, such as graphs, headers, footers, and images.
